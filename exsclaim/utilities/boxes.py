"""Module for handling bounding box coordinates

Throughout the models and data formats used in exsclaim, bounding
boxes are sometimes stored as x1,y1,x2,y2 or 'coords' and sometimes
as [{"x": x1, "y": y1}, ...] or 'labelbox'

In addition, we often want to check the relation of two bounding
boxes and their properites (like center point)
