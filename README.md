## Introduction

EXSCLAIM! is a Python package that can be used for the automatic generation of datasets of labelled images from published papers. It in three main steps:
1. [JournalScraper](https://github.com/MaterialEyes/exsclaim/wiki/JournalScraper): scrap journal websites, acquiring figures, captions, and metadata
2. [CaptionDistributor](https://github.com/MaterialEyes/exsclaim/wiki/JournalScraper): separate figure captions into the component chunks that refer to the figure's subfigures
3. [FigureSeparator](https://github.com/MaterialEyes/exsclaim/wiki/JournalScraper): separate figures into subfigures, detect scale information, label, and type of image

You can use EXSCLAIM!:
- in a development environment
```
python run.py --query /path/to/query.json
```
- as a direct python import
```
from exsclaim.pipeline import Pipeline
test_pipeline = Pipeline(query)
results = test_pipeline.run()
```
- as [command line interface](https://github.com/MaterialEyes/exsclaim/wiki/Command-Line-Interface)
```
$ exsclaim run /path/to/query.json
```
- as a [user interface](https://github.com/MaterialEyes/exsclaim/wiki/User-Interface)

## Using EXSCLAIM
### Note
The way in which a webpage (content) is delivered to a user can change over time, and thus continued support is necessary to ensure that the design of each journal-specfic scraper/parser is fully functional with the current journal format.

### Requirements
EXSCLAIM works with Python 3.6+. We recommend using a conda or python environment to install dependencies. To use the pipeline, you need a Query on which to run the pipeline. The query can be a JSON or Python dictionary (depending on how you are accessing the pipeline) and must have the parameters(/keys/attributes) defined in the [Query JSON schema](https://github.com/MaterialEyes/exsclaim/wiki/JSON-Schema#query-json-) and examples can be found [in the query directory](https://github.com/MaterialEyes/exsclaim/tree/master/query).

### Installation
There are multiple ways to use EXSCLAIM. If you wish to develop or modify the source code, see [Git Clone](#gitclone) installation instructions. If you simply wish to utilize the package, see the [Pip](#pip) installation instructions. For utilizing EXSCLAIM's User Interface (which is useful if you want to avoid writing any code or want an easy to way to view results), see [UI](#ui) instructions.

#### Git Clone (Recommended)
To setup a development environment from the GitHub repository, run the following commands (a Python 3.10 venv virtual environment is provided as an example):
```
git clone https://github.com/MaterialEyes/exsclaim.git
cd exsclaim
python3.10 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
bash exsclaim/utilities/download_model_checkpoints.sh
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm 
```

#### Pip
To install the latest stable release:
```
pip install exsclaim
python -m spacy download en_core_web_sm
```

#### Docker
To start container:
`docker-compose up`
To re-build:
`docker-compose up --build`

To run in python shell
`docker exec -it <service_name> bash`

If you run into errors, please check [Troubleshooting](https://github.com/MaterialEyes/exsclaim/wiki/Troubleshooting). If they persist, please open an issue.


### Enable Journal Scraping for Dynamic Webpages
To scrape from journals that use javascript (e.g., RSC, ACS), you need to setup chrome and chromedriver and add their path to the `exsclaim/journal.py` file. 

E.g. for a linux terminal you need the following:
```
wget https://dl.google.com/linux/direct/google-chrome-stable_current_amd64.deb
wget https://chromedriver.storage.googleapis.com/90.0.4430.24/chromedriver_linux64.zip
```
