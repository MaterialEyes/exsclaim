Installation
===============

To install and use exsclaim, you can use pip, Docker, or you can clone
the git repository.

Which method should I use?
----------------------------
Installing with pip can often be the quickest and simplest, but you may
run into issues specific to your operating system. Docker is the recommended
way to use exsclaim and if you run into issues with the pip install that
you cannot resolve, you should certainly try docker.

For those with intensive use cases or those interested in contributing to
exsclaim (thanks!), you should clone the repository and look at the instructions
in contributing.
